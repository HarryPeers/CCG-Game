A simple colour picker game where you have to guess the same colour as the computer. Computer gets a point if you loose, if the player wins the player gets a point
best of 5 rounds. I used ANSI to use coloured text and used the terminal with os.system("cls") to clear the screen and make a dynamic score board.
